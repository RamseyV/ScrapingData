# ScrapingData
This is a jupyter notebook that scrapes data from different websites in python. 
The first problem returns the title and date of the nth most recent article from http://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=&sort=metadata_created+desc.
The second problem finds the most recent press conference from https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings.
The third problem accepts a starting and ending year to scrape http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executions_by_year.html to find all executions between and including those years
The last problem finds and lists the active senators that have the most Twitter followers, the fewest Twitter followers, and how many people retweeted and liked the 10 most recent tweets by the senator.
